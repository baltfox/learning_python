## Task: Recursive Functions

### Description

Learn to create various recursive functions that satisfy input conditions

### Requirements

 - Implement functions in the [app.py](app.py) using the recursion approach. Use tests from [test_direct_recursion.py](test_direct_recursion.py) and [test_indirect_recursion.py](test_indirect_recursion.py) as a hint for realisation
 - All tests from [test_direct_recursion.py](test_direct_recursion.py) and [test_indirect_recursion.py](test_indirect_recursion.py) should pass
