## Task: Implement a Funny and Simple Console Program with a User Menu

### Description

Create a Python program that presents a console-based user menu with a few light-hearted and fun options. The program should be simple, interactive, and should include humor. The goal is to practice creating a console menu, handling user input, and writing functions that are both functional and entertaining. Below are the requirements for the program:

### Requirements

1. **User Menu:**
   - When the program starts, it should display a menu with at least 3 options.
   - The menu should be presented as a numbered list, allowing the user to select an option by entering the corresponding number.
   - Include an option to exit the program.

2. **Menu Options:**
   Implement the following three options:

   - **Option 1: "Dad Joke Generator":**
     - When selected, the program should randomly display a dad joke from a predefined list of jokes.
   
   - **Option 2: "Fortune Cookie":**
     - When selected, the program should simulate opening a fortune cookie and reveal a random fortune from a predefined list.
   
   - **Option 3: "Magic 8-Ball":**
     - When selected, the program should allow the user to ask a yes/no question and receive a random answer from a list of typical Magic 8-Ball responses (e.g., "Yes", "No", "Ask again later", etc.).

3. **Input Validation:**
   - Ensure the user input is validated. For example, if the user enters an invalid option number, the program should prompt them to enter a valid choice instead of crashing.

4. **Exit Option:**
   - The menu should include an option to exit the program. When this option is selected, the program should thank the user for playing and terminate gracefully.

5. **Optional Enhancements:**
   - Add any other creative or humorous features to make the program more fun.
   - Consider adding ASCII art or other console-based visual elements for extra flair.

### Example Output

```plaintext

Please choose an option:
1. Dad Joke Generator
2. Fortune Cookie
3. Magic 8-Ball
4. Exit

Enter your choice (1-4): 1

Why don't skeletons fight each other? They don't have the guts! ðŸ¤£

Press Enter to return to the menu...
```

### Submission

- Submit your Python code with comments explaining the key parts of the implementation.
- Make sure your program runs correctly and all options function as expected.
